 LICENSE

Modding creations of other creators is great for learning
some things about how stuff works, but before you
get to modifying my datapacks, you'll need to read the license
below and follow it.

Feel free to ask questions about this license and more
on my Discord server: https://discord.gg/SyEGYGr5BF 


============================================
-- PERMITTED USES ---
============================================

- You are PERMITTED to freely use this modification on singleplayer worlds and multiplayer 
worlds in your Minecraft game. All Splatus created packs will also follow under 
this rule. 

- You are PERMITTED to modify parts of this packs code in single player or in your own servers,
but you are NOT permitted to redistribute your modified pack UNLESS under consent of Splatus. If 
you want a feature added to one of my packs you can always suggest it on my discord

- You are PERMITTED to view this packs code and take reference of it. You are NOT permitted to
directly copy parts of this work into your own projects

- You are PERMITTED to use my packs in your own modpacks, please put credit though! Do not
claim these packs as your own creations in these modpacks!

- You are PERMITTED to make content on platforms such as Youtube, Instagram, Twitter and
other media/social media platforms relating to my packs. You may also monetize 
videos of these kinds. 






============================================
-- PROHIBITED USES ---
============================================

- You may NOT redistribute this mod out by your own name. Reuploading of this pack
is NOT permitted.

- You may NOT redistribute modified versions of this pack either

- You may NOT redistribute modified versions of this pack that add new features. 
This will still count as modifying my pack even if its "adding" to it.

- You may NOT use parts of this datapack in your own datapacks or mods, directly
copying and pasting my code into your works. (Unless its single lines and minor parts like such)

- You may NOT redistribute single parts of this pack either (standalones and such
not permitted)




============================================
-- GRAY ZONE ---
============================================

- This pack is only allowed to be modified and used in your single
player worlds and servers. Do NOT redistribute to other players or servers

- Addons and compatiblity are allowed, but it still must follow
the rule to not steal code or assets. Obviously, I don't own the
namespace "1_splatus" or "ultris" really, so referencing 1_splatus
or ultris in lines of code is permitted for compatiblity with your
own datapacks

- I don't really like cracked/pirated users using my datapacks. Please
consider giving Mojang the money they deserve for their game

- Mojang Studios may use all content provided in this pack as part of their
vanilla game. They gave me the creative power to even create this pack.

-All works of Splatus are of and owned by Splatus. Exceptions to this license
may be granted to certain individuals.
